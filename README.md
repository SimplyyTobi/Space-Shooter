# Space-Shooter
**Space Shooter** is a small, solo 2D project for one of my study courses "Game Engines" made in Unity. It's a top-down endless scroller, in which you try to survive as long as possible by destroying incoming enemy ships and collecting useful power-ups.

## Core Gameplay Features:
- WASD Movement
- Enemy Spawns and Destruction
- Shooting System
- Health System
- (High-)Score System
- A Boss Fight
- 3 Different Power-Ups

## Status:
This game is work-in-progress. I may return to polish and expand it in the future.
